## 🚀 The Blu Experience

### 🧠 Intelligence, Unbound
Supported by every world-class AI provider. Whether you prefer **Claude 3.7**, **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, or **GPT-4o**, Blu speaks them all. Mix and match models for different tasks—titles, summaries, or deep-dives.

### 🛠️ Tool-Integrated Workflow
Blu isn't just a chatbot; it's an operator.
- **File System Mastery**: Glob, grep, read, and write with surgical precision.
- **System Execution**: Run bash commands directly from the chat.
- **Smart Patching**: Apply complex diffs and refactors automatically.

### 💎 Premium Terminal UI
Built with the [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework, Blu offers a state-of-the-art interface:
- **Session Focus**: Switch between multiple context-heavy sessions instantly (`Ctrl+S`).
- **Interactive Sidebar**: Visualize file changes and diffs in real-time.
- **Vim-like Command Pallet**: Execute custom logic at the speed of thought.
